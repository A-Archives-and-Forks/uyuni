Spacewalk
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spacewalkproject/spacewalk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spacewalkproject/spacewalk/builds)

Spacewalk is an open source Linux systems management solution that was the
beginning of [SUSE Manager](https://www.suse.com/products/suse-manager/).

[SUSE Manager](https://www.suse.com/products/suse-manager/) and [RedHatSatellite](https://www.redhat.com/products/enterprise-linux/satellite/) were derived from Spacewalk.

Since 2018, the upstream version of [SUSE Manager](https://www.suse.com/products/suse-manager/) is [Uyuni](https://www.uyuni-project.org/).

Uyuni is open for patches from the community, and all contributions are
considered for inclusion in the [SUSE Manager](https://www.suse.com/products/suse-manager/) product.

For information on how to work with multiple repositories and how to
contribute, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/spacewalkproject/spacewalk/wiki).

You can open bugs against [SUSE Manager](https://www.suse.com/products/suse-manager/) in [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.suse.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=SUSE%20Manager%203.2).
