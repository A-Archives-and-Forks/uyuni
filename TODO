Work for SUSE Manager
=====================

* Errors in apache configuration
  - Some Alias do not work because default-server.conf specify a ScriptAlias

* schema migration from susemanager 1.2.X to susemanager 1.6.X

* susemanager requires oracle-xe-univ ; not needed in case of postgres

DONE
====
* tomcat does not find webapps/rhn . appBase on SUSE seems to be
  /usr/share/tomcat6/webapps which is a symlink to /srv/tomcat6/webapps
  But rhn/ exists in /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps
  See /etc/tomcat6/Catalina/localhost/rhn.xml 
  docBase="/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/rhn/" was removed

* rhn_server_susemanager.conf is still in /etc/rhn/defaults; move to 
  /usr/share/rhn/config-defaults/

* Errors in apache configuration
  - "Header" is used which requires mod_headers (add to sysconfig/apache)

* permissions on /etc/rhn/rhn.conf are "640 root.root"
  but should be "640 root.www". Find out were the error is
