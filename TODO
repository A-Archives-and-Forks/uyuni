Work for SUSE Manager
=====================
- check, how to move entitlements to a sub organization
  verify, that the calculation during update is correct
  (
    org1 = total - SUM(org > 1) 
    if org1 < 0 reduce the entitlements for org > 1
  )

- add entitlement handling for monitoring, provisioning, virtual, ...
  - add the numbers for the available entitlements
  - everytime the admin add/remove such an entitlement to a client
    add/remove the product for this entitlement to the suseServer

- mgr-ncc-sync called without options should do:
  1) update channel families
  2) update the suseProducts
  3) update entitlements (Subscriptions)
  4) walk over all existing channels with org_id == NULL
     and trigger a reposync

- mgr-ncc-sync --list-channels or --channels should
  only show the available channels for this customer.
  the channels.xml file include all exiting channels,
  but the customer may not have access to all of them.
  The only way to get the customer channels is, to
  download repo/repoindex.xml from nu.novell.com 
  and compare it with channels.xml.
  Only channels where the customer has access to all included
  repositories are available to the customer.
  Additionally we need to check, if the customer has access
  to the base channel, if the available channel is a child channel.

- nu.novell.com requires authentication to download the repository.
  find a way to "tag" the urls and modify spacewalk-repo-sync 
  to read and add the credentials before the download starts.
  (e.g. the URLs get a query parameter ?credentials=mirrcred
   spacewalk-repo-sync look into the config for mirrcred_user
   and mirrcred_pass and use the values as username and password
   for the URL)

- fill suseProductChannel

- implement auto channel assignment using suseProductChannel


Work for the PROXY
==================
- implement suse product registration into proxy.
- check, what else is needed for the proxy.
