Deadline:

- [ ] Approve all RRs and ping Maintenance so they can release
- [ ] Ping #doc.suse.com-request (Rocket.Chat, usually Stefan Knorr), so they sync the repository to get documentation.suse.com
- [ ] Check if you can find salt MIs for Leap using `osc sm salt`. If any of them is missing, ping salt squad. (remove this task for MUs that do not include client tools)
- [ ] Wait a couple of hours and announce to the suse-manager@suse.de mailing list.
