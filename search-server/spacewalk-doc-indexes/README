Nutch must be installed on the system.  I was unable to get the crawl to work using the old nutch version that was available via yum repos (fedora or rhel6).  I used the latest 1.x version from apache-nutch project at the time - apache-nutch-1.13.  Download the tgz file here - http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/nutch/1.13/apache-nutch-1.13-bin.tar.gz.  Extract this into /usr/share to create the directory /usr/share/apache-nutch-1.13.  Then create a softlink /usr/share/nutch to this directory.  If you already have nutch installed on the system from a rpm, either uninstall it or change the directory to nutch.sav before creating the softlink.

Before running, I deleted the log files in the logs directory as well as the data/crawl_www directory.

To run:
1) ./crawl_www.sh
2) make test-srpm (or similar build step)
3) install the RPM
4) restart search-server (/sbin/service rhn-search restart)
