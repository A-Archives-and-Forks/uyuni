This package will generate lucene index files for help documents.
The specific docs which will be examined are created by the script:
create_urls_per_language.py

Nutch must be installed on the system, a RPM is provided at ../../spec-tree/nutch

To run:
1) ./crawl_jsp.sh
Note:  We are now processing something on the order of 20+ languages.  
Each languages takes around ~1-2 minutes to crawl.  Expect this step to take about 30-40 minutes.
2) make test-srpm (or similar build step)
3) install the RPM
4) restart search-server (/sbin/service rhn-search restart)

To test:
