.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The RHN Configuration Client (\fBrhncfg-client\fR) is used to query a
system's configuration makeup and deployment status as managed by RHN.
.PP
This tool enables an Spacewalk client to \fBlist\fR available
configuration files, fetch (or \fBget\fR) those
configuration files, \fBview\fR configuration channels, and
finally, \fBdiff\fR and \fBverify\fR current
configuration of the system in comparison to the system's status according
to RHN.
.PP

This tool utilizes a "cvs style" command syntax: command mode options

For example: rhncfg-client diff --topdir /home/test/blah/
.SH "MODE & OPTIONS"
.TP
\fBlist\fR
List the configuration files for the machine and the labels
of the config channels containing them. Used alone.
.TP
\fBelist\fR
List the configuration files for the machine and the labels
of the config channels containing them which provides an
ls-esque style output. Used alone.
.TP
\fBget \fICONFIG_FILEPATH\fB\fR
Download/deploy the most relevant configuration file for the
machine. For example: rhncfg-client get /etc/foo.conf
.TP
\fBchannels\fR
View the labels and names of the config channels that apply to
the system. Used alone.
.TP
\fBdiff\fR
Obtain a difference between the config files deployed on the
system and those for it stored by Spacewalk server.

May be used with the --topdir \fIROOT_PATH\fR
option. E.g., rhncfg-client diff --topdir /home/test/foo/
.TP
\fBverify\fR
Quick verification to see if files are different than those
associated with it on Spacewalk server.

All files are displayed unless called with the -o or --only
option, in which case only files with differences are displayed.

If a file is readable only by root then the differences are not displayed by 
default. The option -d or --diff-secure-files forces the differences to be 
displayed.
.TP
\fB-h, --help\fR
Display the help screen with a list of options.
